## About Me

Hello! This portfolio showcases selected projects I’ve developed during my master’s program, combining data science, quantitative finance, and practical market insight. With a foundation in both programming and financial theory, and prior experience in client-facing and operational roles, I aim to bridge the gap between rigorous analysis and actionable results.
